      <h1>Internet Technologies, Data Transmission and Cloud Computing</h1>
      <p>
        This webpage demonstrates core internet technologies, data transmission methods,
        and cloud computing concepts. It integrates structured research with HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript to explain how information travels across networks and how cloud
        platforms support modern web applications.

      <h2>Internet Technology and DNS</h2>
      <p>
        The Domain Name System, commonly known as DNS, allows users to access websites
        using readable domain names instead of numerical IP addresses. When a user
        types a URL into a browser, the request is sent to a DNS server which translates
        the domain name into its corresponding IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the local DNS server does not already have the record, the request is passed
        through a hierarchy of DNS servers including ISP servers, top level domain
        servers, and root servers. Once the correct IP address is found, routers deliver
        the data packet to the correct web server.

      <h2>Broadband and Data Transmission</h2>
      <p>
        Broadband is a high speed internet connection that allows continuous data
        transmission. Fiber optic broadband transmits data using light signals through
        glass cables, enabling high bandwidth, low latency, and long distance
        communication with minimal interference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data transmission methods are classified as simplex, half duplex, or full
        duplex. Full duplex transmission allows data to be sent and received at the
        same time, making it ideal for applications such as video calls and online
        gaming.

      <h2>Data Transmission and Error Checking</h2>
      <p>
        During data transmission, errors may occur due to noise, interference, or signal
        degradation. Error checking methods are used to detect and correct these issues
        to ensure data integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common error checking techniques include parity bits, checksums, and cyclic
        redundancy checks. These methods allow the receiving device to detect corrupted
        data and request retransmission when necessary.

      <h2>Cloud Computing and Storage</h2>
      <p>
        Cloud computing provides on demand access to computing resources such as storage,
        processing power, and databases over the internet. Unlike traditional storage,
        cloud storage does not rely on a single local device.
      </p>
      <p>
        Client side technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript run in the browser,
        while server side systems operate in the cloud. This separation allows web
        applications to scale efficiently and support multiple users.
