      <p>
        This web page demonstrates modern internet technologies, including DNS servers, broadband connections, data transmission methods, error-checking techniques, USB technology, and cloud computing systems. 
        The project integrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive and visually engaging learning experience.

    <!-- ================= DNS SECTION ================= -->
    <section>
      <h2>1. Internet Technology: DNS Servers</h2>

      <p>
        The <strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong> translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. For example, <em>www.google.com</em> is resolved to an IP like <em>142.250.185.206</em>. DNS uses a hierarchical lookup system from local, ISP, higher-level, and root servers to find addresses efficiently.
      </p>

      <p>
        DNS simplifies browsing, allows websites to move servers without affecting users, and provides a scalable global addressing system.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Entering <em>www.onlinegames.co.uk</em> sends a request to a DNS server that either resolves it or queries higher-level servers until the IP is returned, allowing the browser to connect to the web server.

    <!-- ================= BROADBAND SECTION ================= -->
    <section>
      <h2>2. Broadband Connection Technology</h2>

      <p>
        Broadband provides high-speed internet access for data transmission. Fiber-optic broadband uses light signals through glass fibers for extremely fast, low-latency, and reliable connections. This makes it ideal for cloud computing, streaming, and real-time communication.
      </p>

    <!-- ================= DATA TRANSMISSION ================= -->
    <section>
      <h2>3. Data Transmission</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Data transmission</strong> moves bits from sender to receiver using various methods. It can be classified by direction (simplex, half-duplex, full-duplex), method (serial vs parallel), and synchronization (asynchronous vs synchronous). 
        Key factors affecting method choice include distance, speed requirements, noise, latency, synchronization needs, hardware cost, and connector compatibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>USB technology</strong> is a serial standard with four wires (VBUS, D–, D+, GND) allowing plug-and-play connection between host and peripherals. Benefits include backward compatibility, power delivery, and multiple transfer types; limits include cable length and latency.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Error checking</strong> ensures accurate data delivery. Methods include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Parity bits (single or 2-D block) to detect/correct simple errors</li>
        <li>Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) with ACK/NAK retransmission</li>
        <li>Checksum and echo checks to detect transmission errors</li>
        <li>Advanced methods: CRC and FEC for robust detection/correction without retransmission</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- ================= CLOUD COMPUTING ================= -->
    <section>
      <h2>4. Cloud Computing & Web Applications</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Cloud computing</strong> delivers computing services over the internet. Users access storage, databases, software, and processing power from remote servers rather than local devices. Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud provide scalable infrastructure with pay-as-you-go pricing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cloud benefits include cost efficiency, reliability, remote access, automatic updates, and rapid scalability. Limitations include dependence on internet connectivity and cybersecurity risks, requiring strong encryption, MFA, and access controls.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Web applications</strong> combine client-side technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with server-side processing (Python, PHP, SQL, APIs) to deliver interactive experiences. Virtual networks extend this connectivity logically, but require strong encryption and security practices.
      </p>

    <!-- ================= REFLECTION ================= -->
    <section>
      <h2>Reflection on Learning Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Initially, I could not analyze data-transmission types, USB technology, error-checking methods, or cloud computing thoroughly. Now, I can compare methods based on speed, distance, and synchronization; explain USB connection and limitations; evaluate error-checking techniques; and explain cloud computing models, benefits, and risks. I also understand DNS resolution, URL structure, IoT devices, and how broadband and cloud platforms interact for modern web services.
