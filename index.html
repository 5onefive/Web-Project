      <h1>Internet Technology, Data Transmission & Cloud Computing</h1>
      <p>
        This interactive webpage demonstrates how core internet technologies operate
        behind the scenes. It explores DNS resolution, broadband connectivity, data
        transmission methods, error-checking techniques, and cloud computing models,
        integrating theory with visual design and JavaScript-based interactivity.

    <section>
      <h2>1. Internet Technology: DNS and URL Resolution</h2>

      <p>
        The <strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong> is often described as the internet’s
        phonebook. While users access websites using readable domain names such as
        <em>www.onlinegames.co.uk</em>, computers communicate using numerical
        <strong>IP addresses</strong>. DNS bridges this gap by translating domain names
        into IP addresses.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a user enters a URL into a browser, the request is sent to a DNS server.
        If the server does not recognize the domain, it forwards the request up the DNS
        hierarchy, through ISP servers and top-level domain servers, until the correct IP
        address is found or the root server is reached. Once resolved, routers use the IP
        address to deliver the data packet to the correct web server.
      </p>

      <p>
        This hierarchical DNS system allows websites to change physical servers without
        affecting users, improves scalability, and removes the need for memorizing long
        numerical addresses.

    <section>
      <h2>2. Broadband and Data Transmission Technologies</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Broadband</strong> refers to high-speed internet connections that enable
        continuous data transmission over long distances. Modern broadband technologies
        include fiber-optic, DSL, cable, and wireless networks. Fiber-optic broadband is
        especially effective because it transmits data as light signals, providing high
        bandwidth, low latency, and resistance to electromagnetic interference.
      </p>

      <p>
        Data transmission technologies are classified by direction (simplex,
        half-duplex, or full-duplex), method (serial or parallel), and synchronization
        (asynchronous or synchronous). These design choices depend on factors such as
        distance, required speed, noise, cost, and compatibility.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Data Transmission and Error Checking</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Full-duplex transmission</strong> allows data to be sent and received
        simultaneously, making it essential for real-time communication such as video
        calls and online gaming. Unlike simplex or half-duplex systems, both endpoints
        can transmit without waiting.
      </p>

      <div class="diagram">
        <div class="box">Sender</div>
        <div class="arrow">⇄</div>
        <div class="box">Receiver</div>
      </div>

      <p>
        During transmission, errors may occur due to noise, signal degradation, or timing
        issues. Error-checking methods such as <strong>parity bits</strong>,
        <strong>checksums</strong>, and <strong>automatic repeat request (ARQ)</strong>
        are used to detect corrupted data and ensure integrity. Stronger techniques such
        as CRC and forward error correction are used in noisy or high-latency networks.

    <!-- ================= CLOUD COMPUTING ================= -->
    <section>
      <h2>4. Cloud Computing and Web Applications</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Cloud computing</strong> delivers services such as storage, databases,
        and processing power over the internet instead of relying on local hardware.
        Cloud platforms host applications on remote servers that clients access through
        browsers or apps.
      </p>

      <p>
        In web development, <strong>client-side technologies</strong> (HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript) execute in the browser, while <strong>server-side systems</strong>
        run in the cloud, handling databases, authentication, and large-scale processing.
        This separation improves scalability, reliability, and collaboration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compared to traditional storage, cloud solutions offer automatic backups,
        global access, cost efficiency, and rapid scaling, but they require internet
        connectivity and strong security practices under a shared-responsibility model.
