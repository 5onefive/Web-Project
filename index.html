<h1>Internet Technology, Data Transmission & Cloud Computing</h1>
<p>This web page organizes detailed research on internet technologies, cloud computing, DNS systems, broadband connections, data transmission methods, USB technologies, error checking, and virtual networks. Each section summarizes the key points, examples, and practical applications to educate users on modern computing concepts.</p>
</header>

<!-- DNS Section -->
<section>
<h2>1. Domain Name System (DNS)</h2>
<p>The <strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong> converts human-readable website names into numerical IP addresses, allowing computers to route data correctly. Without DNS, users would have to remember complex numeric addresses for each website.</p>
<p>DNS uses a hierarchical system: local DNS → ISP DNS → root servers. Requests cascade until the correct IP is found. This ensures reliability, scalability, and fast access across the globe.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Typing <em>www.google.com</em> directs DNS to translate it to <em>142.250.185.206</em> for the browser to access Google's server.</li>
<li>DNS advantages: avoids memorizing IPs, supports server changes, global hierarchical addressing, simplifies internet navigation.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<!-- Broadband Section -->
<section>
<h2>2. Broadband Internet Connections</h2>
<p>Broadband provides high-speed, continuous internet access. Fiber-optic broadband transmits data via light signals over glass fibers, offering minimal latency, high reliability, and very large bandwidth suitable for cloud services, streaming, and online gaming.</p>
<p>Other broadband technologies include DSL, cable, and wireless networks, each varying in speed, cost, and reliability.</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Technology</th><th>Speed</th><th>Usage</th></tr>
<tr><td>USB</td><td>Up to 5 Gbps</td><td>Short-distance local transfer</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fiber Broadband</td><td>100 Mbps – 1+ Gbps</td><td>Long-distance internet communication</td></tr>
</table>
</section>

<!-- Data Transmission Section -->
<section>
<h2>3. Data Transmission Methods</h2>
<p>Data transmission involves moving binary data from sender to receiver. It can be classified by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direction: simplex (one-way), half-duplex (both ways one at a time), full-duplex (both ways simultaneously)</li>
<li>Method: serial (one bit at a time, better for long distances) vs parallel (multiple bits, faster for short distances)</li>
<li>Synchronization: asynchronous (start/stop framing) vs synchronous (continuous clock signal)</li>
</ul>
<p>USB is a common serial communication standard with four wires (VBUS, D-, D+, GND) enabling plug-and-play, backward compatibility, and multiple data transfer types.</p>
<p>Errors can occur due to noise, signal degradation, or interference. Methods to detect or correct errors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parity (single or block) to detect bit flips</li>
<li>ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) with ACK/NAK for reliable retransmission</li>
<li>Checksums and echo checks for verification</li>
<li>Advanced methods: CRCs and FEC (e.g., Reed-Solomon) for error correction without retransmission</li>
</ul>
</section>

<!-- Cloud Computing Section -->
<section>
<h2>4. Cloud Computing & Web Applications</h2>
<p><strong>Cloud computing</strong> provides storage, databases, software, and processing power via the internet. Services are hosted on remote servers and accessed through web browsers or apps.</p>
<p>Benefits include on-demand service, scalability, remote access, automated backups, cost efficiency, and resource pooling. Risks involve dependency on internet connectivity and potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Web applications combine front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end (Python, PHP, SQL, APIs) technologies, enabling dynamic and interactive experiences. Cloud servers process heavy workloads, store large datasets, and maintain security.</p>
</section>

<!-- Virtual Networks Section -->
<section>
<h2>5. Virtual Networks</h2>
<p>Virtual networks connect devices logically over the internet rather than via physical cables. They offer flexibility, remote access, and scalability, but require strong encryption and security practices to protect data and resources.</p>
